	<!--About Me -->
   <p >Hi, I'm Anita Dixon. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Learning Design &amp; Technology with concentrations in eLearning and Big Data &amp Learning Analytics at the University of South Florida. At the same time, I am also completing a graduate certificate in Web Design. Some of the projects I've worked on for my degree can be viewed <a href="http://mcphersona.myweb.usf.edu/"> here</a> or 
  <a href="http://mcphersona.myweb.usf.edu/FinalProject/"> here</a>.</p>
		
  <p>Last year, I learned basic HTML and CSS in my Web Design class. This semester, I'm taking Web Programming I. I'll expand my knowledge of those languages as well as learn Javascript. Eventually this page will be populated with links to all of my class assignments so that you can view my progress as I develop my web programming skills.</p>
