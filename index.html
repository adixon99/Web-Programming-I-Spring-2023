<p>Hi, I'm Anita Dixon. I'm a graduate student in the Learning Design &amp; Technology program at USF pursuing dual concentrations in eLearning Design and Development &amp; Big Data and Learning Analytics, along with a graduate certificate in Web Design.
</p>


<p> Examples of previous coursework in which I've utilized web design skills can be viewed 
<a href="http://mcphersona.myweb.usf.edu/"> here</a> or <a href="http://mcphersona.myweb.usf.edu/FinalProject/"> here</a>.
</p>
	
<p>This semester, I'm taking Web Programming I. I have very basic programming skills in HTML and CSS, so I'll be expanding my knowledge of those, as well as learning Javascript. I'll also utilize Visual Studio Code to write code.</p> 

<p>During the semester, this page will be updated with clickable links to my class assignments so you can view my progress.</p>
